Q: Why make this project?
A: I wanted to acquaint myself with C, low-level programming, and complete 
a project using Vim. 

Q: What functionality does this project currently support?
A: This project comprises a shell that can execute 'cd', 'help', and 'exit' bash commands. 


Q: How will you improve it moving forward?
A: I will add support for more complex input, and provide additional functionality for 'ls', 'mkdir' and 'rm' bash commands. Additionally,
I would like to recreate some form of piping for my shell as well.
